# Governance Philosophy

## A2AX-Core Is Not

- A centralized registry
- A marketplace
- A tokenized system
- A ranking platform
- An economic exchange layer

## A2AX-Core Is

- Infrastructure — the trust substrate upon which autonomous economic systems can be built
- A trust verification standard
- A pluggable identity layer
- A neutral infrastructure component
- Commercially extensible

## Principles

1. **Verifier-controlled trust**: Each deployment chooses whom to trust
2. **No embedded anchors**: Empty trust store by default
3. **Portable verification**: Works without registry
4. **Fork-safe**: Protocol compiles and runs independently
5. **Vendor-neutral**: No hardcoded A2AX-Core endpoints or commercial hooks
