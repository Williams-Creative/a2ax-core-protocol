# A2AX-Core Manifesto

## Trust Is Infrastructure

Autonomous agents are transitioning from tools to actors.

They will:

- Negotiate
- Execute contracts
- Transfer value
- Make decisions
- Represent human and institutional interests

As this transition accelerates, intelligence alone is insufficient.

The agent economy will not fail due to lack of intelligence.

It will fail due to lack of trust.

Trust must become infrastructure.

---

## The Problem

Today, agent trust is:

- Platform-bound
- Registry-dependent
- Implicit
- Centrally mediated

Verification is often replaced with:

- Allowlists
- Hard-coded identities
- Blind execution
- Opaque trust scoring

These approaches do not scale beyond single ecosystems.

They create fragmentation, lock-in, and systemic fragility.

---

## The Requirement

Autonomous systems must be able to:

- Identify themselves cryptographically
- Declare capabilities explicitly
- Establish secure sessions
- Sign attestations
- Be evaluated under programmable trust policy

Without requiring:

- Central registries
- Platform ownership
- Embedded trust anchors
- Mandatory intermediaries

Trust must be portable.

Trust must be contextual.

Trust must be verifier-controlled.

---

## The Position

A2AX-Core defines:

- Identity primitives
- Verification mechanics
- Capability scoping
- Trust evaluation interfaces
- Secure A2A handshake

It does not define:

- Who is trusted
- Which issuers are valid
- What policies must apply
- What economic systems must exist

Those decisions remain external.

The protocol enforces mechanics — not authority.

---

## Neutrality

A2AX-Core embeds:

- No mandatory trust anchors
- No central registry
- No governance lock-in
- No economic enforcement layer

The trust store ships empty.

Forking is permitted.

Independent implementations are valid.

Neutrality is structural — not rhetorical.

---

## Portability

Certificates are:

- Self-contained
- Cryptographically verifiable
- Registry-independent

Verification does not require contacting a central authority.

Trust decisions remain local.

---

## Extensibility

The protocol is layered:

Layer 1 — Core trust primitives  
Layer 2 — Optional extensions  
Layer 3 — Independent services  

Extensions must not compromise neutrality.

The core remains minimal.

---

## What A2AX-Core Is Not

A2AX-Core is not:

- A marketplace
- A ranking system
- A token network
- A centralized registry
- A managed trust graph

It is infrastructure.

It defines the trust substrate upon which autonomous economic systems can be built.

---

## The Long View

Standards outlast companies.

Protocols outlast products.

Infrastructure must not depend on a single operator.

If autonomous systems are to interact across institutions, jurisdictions, and economic domains, trust must be:

- Cryptographically verifiable
- Portable
- Contextual
- Verifier-controlled
- Open

A2AX-Core exists to define that substrate.

Nothing more.

Nothing less.
